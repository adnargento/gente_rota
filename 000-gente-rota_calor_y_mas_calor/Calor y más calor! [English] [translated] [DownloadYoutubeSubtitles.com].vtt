a shitty life because he probably doesn't

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.500
want to go back home because his

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.880

normal terms no one can ever

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.760
like having 35 degrees in the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.920
center of the sunrise at this time no one

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.420
No one can like it, no one I'm already

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.340
sweating, I'm all stuck I want to

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.899
grab the steering wheel, all the plastic is sticking to me,

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.000
this one on the steering wheel, this

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.160
shitty one that gathers heat even in the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.140
mirror, even Poronga, there's a son of a

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.760
[ __ ] who came in six years ago.  months at

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.800
work and they already gave him a flat with air

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.000
conditioning it seems that I must fall

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.820
like hell

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.339
walking around in this twisted [ __ ] that gathers

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.700
more heat than idiotic mercury I want

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.700
to die
