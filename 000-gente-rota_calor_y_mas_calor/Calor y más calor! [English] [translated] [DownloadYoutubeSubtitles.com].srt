like having 35 degrees in the

20
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,920
center of the sunrise at this time no one

21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,420
No one can like it, no one I'm already

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,340
sweating, I'm all stuck I want to

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,899
grab the steering wheel, all the plastic is sticking to me,

24
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,000
this one on the steering wheel, this

25
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,160
shitty one that gathers heat even in the

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,140
mirror, even Poronga, there's a son of a

27
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,760
[ __ ] who came in six years ago.  months at

28
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,800
work and they already gave him a flat with air

29
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,000
conditioning it seems that I must fall

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,820
like hell

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,339
walking around in this twisted [ __ ] that gathers

32
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,700
more heat than idiotic mercury I want

33
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,700
to die
