00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
I know, I know, what you must do is train.

2
00:00:03,326 --> 00:00:08,686
The thing about gymnastics is that you release endorphins, do you understand?

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:14,000
And that helps with stress relief, depression, among other things.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,680
I mean, gymnastics really help out in so many ways.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,120
The thing is, when someone doesn't have the physical... attitude,

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,680
when one doesn't have the willpower.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,880
Tell me where I can find it because if there's somewhere selling me

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,360
willpower or the right attitude towards training, going to the gym.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,120
Oh my God, please tell me where it is because I just don't have it.

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,480
I don't have it, I can't seem to find it, it's nowhere inside me.

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,080
Wherever the hell I left it, assuming it exists since everyone says,

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,440
You start off...

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,400
Once you get started with the gym, you always feel like doing more.

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,360
It never happened to me before!

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,840
I hate it! I go to the gym, work out, and come back swearing. Do you understand me?

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,080
Because sometimes, I just don't feel like going.

17
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,800
All I want to do is sit at home; I don't feel like working out.

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,720
What am I supposed to do, sister?
