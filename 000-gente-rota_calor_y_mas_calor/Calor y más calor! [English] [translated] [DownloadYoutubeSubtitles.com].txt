The forecast for the end of according to what

I read was the morning of heat and

heat and heat because on top of that tomorrow

it was supposed to rain but it read

36 degrees so tomorrow In addition to the fact that the

heat is going to [ __ ] you the humidity is going

to  hit a rape and the mosquitoes are going to start

coming out because I have sung

that when it is humid the

mosquitoes come out they are going to [ __ ] on you eating the

mosquitoes [ __ ] summer the truth

is [ __ ] I don't know who the [ __ ]

likes this the guy who likes it  This is

because he likes to have a hard time because he has

a shitty life because he probably doesn't

want to go back home because his

family must hate him Because in

normal terms no one can ever

like having 35 degrees in the

center of the sunrise at this time no one

No one can like it, no one I'm already

sweating, I'm all stuck I want to

grab the steering wheel, all the plastic is sticking to me,

this one on the steering wheel, this

shitty one that gathers heat even in the

mirror, even Poronga, there's a son of a

[ __ ] who came in six years ago.  months at

work and they already gave him a flat with air

conditioning it seems that I must fall

like hell

walking around in this twisted [ __ ] that gathers

more heat than idiotic mercury I want

to die
