00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
The forecast for the weekend, according to what I read this morning, is hot, hot, hot.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,800
Because tomorrow supposedly it's going to rain, but it marks 36 degrees, which means that tomorrow...

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,680
in addition to being scorching hot, the humidity will hit you like a ton of bricks and the mosquitoes will start coming out because...

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,520
it's obvious, whenever there's humidity, the mosquitoes come out.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:24,080
They'll drive you crazy biting you, damn summer, honestly it sucks, I don't know...

6
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28,320
who the hell likes this, whoever likes this must enjoy suffering because...

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,480
they probably have a crappy life, since they probably don't want to go home because their family must hate them.

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,960
Under normal circumstances, nobody enjoys having 35-degree heat right up their butt at this time of day, nobody, nobody already feels sticky and sweaty.

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:44,640
I want to grab the steering wheel, everything sticks to me, including this stupid steering wheel that even heats up on the mirrors, goddammit!

10
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:57,400
There's some son of a bitch who started working six months ago and already got assigned a car with air conditioning.

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,120
It seems like I piss them off royally, still driving around in this piece of junk that gets hotter than mercury, God, I feel like dying!
